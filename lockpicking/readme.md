# Installation
Drag and drop into resources folder.
Start lockpick in server.cfg (renaming the resource probably not supported).
Set receipt and email in credentials.lua.
NOTE: Your receipt and email are found on modit.store, under your transaction history.
      Use the same 4 character receipt (example receipt: #0199) without the hashtag (0199).
      Use the same email associated with the order.
      If all of these are set correctly, the mod should automatically authorize and work immediately.
      If not, contact us through the discord channel above.
